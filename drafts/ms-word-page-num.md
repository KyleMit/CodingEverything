title: Add page numbers to MS Word by Default
tags: ['post', ms-word]

This is going to be going to be pretty quick and pretty helpful if you're like me and would always rather see page numbers on a word document rather than not having them.

Go to your Office Template folder here:

```none
%AppData%\Microsoft\Templates
```
 
Find `Normal.dot` or `Normal.dotm`

Right click and select open. We want to make sure we're editing the template, not using it to create a brand new document.  You should see `Normal.dot` in the Word title bar. If that doesn't work, you can try opening up a new word document and opening the template from there.

Then simply insert page numbers and save

Next time you open up a document it will have page numbers by default.

You can read more about this at [Change the Normal template][Normal.dot]
