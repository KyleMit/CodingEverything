title: Thoughts on User Stories

I just completed a great agile training that has me thinking about the way we gather requirements.  One standout quote comes from Microsoft when they were revamping their production model.  They decreed that:

> Having the wrong requirements is not an excuse for delivering the wrong product.

As an industry whose end product is [working software over comprehensive documentation][agile manifesto], I think this edict deserves serious consideration.  On one hand, there is something fundamentally scary about allowing our failures to extend beyond the scope of following the documentation.  But 

It's a paradigm shift away from documentation for documentations sake and toward functionality that produces value.

So where do user stories fit into this?

Here's a traditional requirement:

> The system shall only display dates in mm/dd/yyyy format

Here it is re-phrased as a User Story

> **As an** application viewer,
> **I want** all dates to presented in mm/dd/yyyy format
> **So that** I can easily calculate the day of the week with a speciality piece of software that requires this date format.
