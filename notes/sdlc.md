###[Software Development Life Cycle][SDLC]

#### Phases:

* Preliminary Analisis
* Systems Analysis
* Requirements Definition
* Systems Design
* Development
* Integration and Testing
* Acceptance, Installation, Deployment
* Maintenance
* Evaluation

###[Software Development Methodologies][SDM]

#### Approaches:

* Waterfall
* Prototyping
* Incremental 
* Spiral 
* Rapid Application Development
* Rational Unified Process
* Agile
* Lean
* Scrum

###[Rational Unified Process][RUP]
Iterative Software Development **Process Framework**
Not a single process, but an adaptable process framework, that is used by organizations ot create appropriate processes.
RUP is a specific implementation of the unified process

#### Four Project Life Cycle Phases

* Inception
* Elaboration
* Construction
* Transition

#### Six Best Practices

* Develop Iteratively
* Manage Requirements
* Use Components
* Model Visually
* Verify Quality
* Control Changes


###[Source Control][source]

####[Available Software][revisionSoftware]

* Client- Server Model
    * Open Source
        * Subversion (SVN)
    * Proprietary
        * IBM ClearCase
        * IBM Rational Team Concert
* Distributed Model
    * Open Source
        * Git

###[Agile Software Development][agile]

#### Agile Manifesto

* **Individuals and Interactions** over Processes and tools
* **Working software** over Comprehensive documentation
* **Custom collaboration** over Contract negotiation
* **Responding to change** over Following a plan

#### Agile methods:

* Kanban
* Lean
* Scrum

###[Unit Testing][Unit Testing]

#### Benefits:

* Find Problems Early
* Facilitates Change
* Simiplifies Integration
* Documentation
* Design

###[Automated Builds][builds]
Act of scripting or automating a wide variety of tasks.

#### Advantages:

* Improve product quality
* Accelerate the compile and link processing
* Eliminate redundant tasks
* Minimize "bad builds"
* Eliminate dependencies on key personnel
* Have history of builsd and releases
* Save time and money


### Improvements

* New Source Control System:
    * [Subversion (SVN)](http://subversion.apache.org/)
    * [TortoiseSVN](http://tortoisesvn.net/)
* Automated Builds
    * [Team City](http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/)
        * Automated Code Review
        * Integrate with Static Code Analysis (R#)
        * Integrate with Unit Testing
* Unit Testing
    * [Rhino Mocks](http://ayende.com/blog/tags/rhino-mocks)
* Behavior Driven Design
    * [SpecFlow](http://www.specflow.org/)
* Update All Projects to .NET 4.0
    * Make use of Best tools we currently have available
