## Lambda Layers

[AWS Lambda layers - AWS Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-layers.html)

> * You can configure your Lambda function to pull in additional code and content in the form of layers.
> * A layer is a ZIP archive that contains libraries, a custom runtime, or other dependencies.
> * With layers, you can use libraries in your function without needing to include them in your deployment package.
