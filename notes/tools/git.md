# Git

## GitHub

* [Github Repo Settings](https://github.com/settings/repositories)
* [Github/Renaming](https://github.com/github/renaming#from-master-to-main)
* [Setting the default branch](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/setting-the-default-branch)

> Choose the default branch for your new personal repositories. You might want to change the default name due to different workflows, or because your integrations still require “master” as the default branch name. You can always change the default branch name on individual repositories.
