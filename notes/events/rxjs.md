* Observable - Stream of Values
* Stream - Between 0 to infinite number of values
* Push based stream - producer of value pushes values
* Convention - variable name ends in dollar sign `$` -> "variable holds reference to observable"
* TypeScript problems - just delete the `.tsconfig`
* Observable `.subscribe()` function
  * similar to `.addEventListener()` in JS
