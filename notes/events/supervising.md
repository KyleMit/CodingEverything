[Dan Pink: The puzzle of motivation | TED Summaries](https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation)

#### Candle Problem

![Candle Solution](https://i.imgur.com/0cYoYse.png)

Functional Fixed-ness - think of it only as a single function

Add $$$ incentive to solve problem -> problem takes longer (dulls thinking and blocks creativity)

**Rewards** - Narrow Focus / minimize peripherals.  Improve outcomes when task is simple and straightforward

Study - D. Ariely, U. Gneezy, G. Lwenstein, & N. Mazar, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston Working Paper No. 05-11, July 2005


**Intrinsic Motivations**:

* **Autonomy** - Choice - which (of 3 tasks) do you want to do first?
* **Mastery** - Competence - demonstrate that we can do it well (we don't like to demonstrate incompetence).
* **Purpose** - Meaning - connecting with vision and mission and values of your organization
* **Belonging** - Team focus - We tend to do things for people we care about and who care about us

Management -> Compliance
Engagement -> Self-direction

Atlassian - Hackathon -> FedEx days ("because you have to deliver something overnight)

20% time - radical amounts of autonomy -> accounts for half of new products
