**Features**:

* Advanced Intellisense
* Live Unit Test Feedback (Enterprise Only)
* Null Exception -> Tells you which variable is the problem
* Run to Click - bypasses intervening breakpoints
* Interact with the Cloud from within VS

**C#7 Features**:

* Out variables - declare inline
* Null expression tree
* Tuples
* Expression-bodied members
* Local Function (same uses as Lambdas and Funcs, but represents a robustly compiled function, rather than a object with performance costs)

```cs
public string label 
{
 get => label;
 set -> this.label = value ?? "Default label";
}
```
