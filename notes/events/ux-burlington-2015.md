### ![Eileen](https://i.imgur.com/hhX96kPs.jpg) [Eileen Webb - Improving Authoring Experience](http://uxburlington.com/speaker/eileen-webb.html)



* Why are you breaking my site
* Authoring Experience (HTML???)

* Now you have a CMS - but it's ugly
	* Joomla
	* Drupal

* What are Content Guidelines
	* ways we attach reminders to each field / type of content
	* Who are the content providers?
		* Dedicated web team
		* Part time editors
		* You (hit by a bus / doing it for tomorrow you)

* Content Model - a representation of all the **content types** and relationships on your site
	* Look for repeating patterns in your content
		* ex. Recipe - Author, Ingredients, Preheat, Instructions, Metadata, Tags
	* Once you have a content model - you can create a form instead of a big WYSIWIG text editor block

* Content Descriptions
	* Write enough, but not too much
	* Names give context
		* content type, type description, field names

* Editorial - what are we saying
	* Voice & tone - link to them
	* Intended Audience (Acronyms)
	* Grammar reminders

* Format - how are we saying it?
	* Field length - min/max
	* What fields are acceptable - font? color?

* Images - not all photos are equal
	* File format (jpeg / png)
	* Shape & size (hero images)
	* Where and how it will be used (thumbnail)

* Build guidelines with your team
	* Designers
	* Developers

* Build *with* not *for* (avoid big reveal)
* Talk to Customer Service ("oh yeah, people call about that all the time")

* Guideline presentation
	* PDF
		* easy, but no one reads them
		* don't keep the manual with the microwave
	* Baked into the CMS
		* information is shown where it's needed
		* always up to date
		* BUT - need a development resources

	* Real World
		* In problem solving, knowing the end state is helpful, even if it's untenable
		* Get your guidelines in HTML

	* Powerful CMS with Untrained Administrator


### ![Jeffry](https://i.imgur.com/GGEUUTbs.jpg) [Jeffrey Pierce - Scaling UX](http://uxburlington.com/speaker/jeffrey-pierce.html)



* Use stickies, post its, big boy stickies (paper board)
	* Small squares - big tip
		* Tons of notes - you can't organize them and you won't go through them

* Schedule
	* Listening Tour
	* Requirements
	* Design
	* Development

* Listening Tour
	* What are we trying to build
	* Outcomes > Output
* Organize / Prioritize

Kano vs Bang vs. Buck Scale

Delight vs. Disgust
Meh --> Must have

Impact / Cost

![kano](https://i.imgur.com/Z1DdGVo.jpg)

* Don't build products for organizations, build for people

* Guerilla / GOOB (Get Out of the Building)
	* Explain why you're there
	* Open ended question
		* Use why/how
		* Allow silence
	* Some ideas fall flat
		* Best-Foot-Forward Filtering
		* Gathered Data on Potential Users

#### Proto - Personas

1. Sketch & Give them a Name
2. Demographic Information
3. Pain Pooints & Needs
4. Potential Solutions

Proto Persona Layout

![Proto-Personas](https://i.imgur.com/udENIh4.png)
	
Proto Persona Example

![Proto Persona Example](https://i.imgur.com/fjbGz1X.jpg)

* Hypothesis Statement:
  * We believe that building *this feature*
  * For *these personas*
  * Will achieve *this outcome*

* Group Design Studio
	* 8 UP (fold sheet 3 times) - have everyone draw what this would look like
		* If you can draw a circle, a triangle, and a square - you're doing better than HTML
	* Discuss
	* 2 UP (fold sheet 1)


* Wire framing
	* Clarity over visual design
	* Use consistent style
	* Use actual content
	* Annotate
		* Describe picture

* Development
	* Come up with quantitative and qualitative measures to test hypothesis
* Quantitative
	* Use Google Analytics
		* Track to your outcomes
		* KPI fishing
*Qualitiative
	* Make developer watch someone else use their product and stay silent (without mansplaining)
		* re-think design



### ![James](https://i.imgur.com/4be61cRs.jpg) [James A Rosen - Making Design by Committee Work](http://uxburlington.com/speaker/james-rosen.html)

Works at from [Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/)

Speaker Deck:
https://speakerdeck.com/jamesarosen/making-design-by-committee-work

* Empathy for the User
	* Featuritis - 
		* ex. Pontiac Aztec
			* Design process
				* Focus Groups
					* Cooler / Tent
		* ex. MS Word's Toolbars
	* Stanford Design process
		1. Empathize
		2. Define
		3. Ideate
		4. Prototype
		5. Test
	* Get into trouble when you start at step 3 with ideas


* Emotional Intelligence
	* Quick Meditation
	* Separate how you feel from who you are
		* Helps disengage from emotions - helpful when you're in  a team

* Mental Biases in Groups
	* Behavrioul Economics
		* Books: nudge, edge
	* Biases
		* Egocentric Bias - Others think like us
		* Planning Fallacy - We're bad at math 
		* Dunning-Kruger Effect - Overestimate our skills
		* Faming Effect - How the same info is presented
		* Bias blind spot - see other's biases but not your own
	* Solutions
		* Groups can help address Egocentrism
		* Groups can't help with planning fallcy - don't like talking about failure
	* Group Biases
		* Cascade effect - Mock-trial verdicts - 
			* group think
				* New relevant info - re-decide
				* Social / political effects - don't want to be seen as stupid
			* Solution - don't put ordered things early on in the beginning
				* design independently
				* post simultaneously
		* Common Knowledge Problem - focus on what everybody knows
			* Hidden Profile - an accurate assessment of the world that the group doesn't see
			* Solution - build formal process to solicit cognitive division
		* Contention and Lost of Focus
			* [Duncker's candle problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candle_problem)
				* Given match, box of pins, and candles
				* Need mental switch

* Parallel Thinking
	* Groups use socratic dialog
		* Forced to debate and be defensive
	* Parallel
		* State the problem
		* Propose a solution
		* Everybody lists pros / cons
		* Select best idea / Remix


* Boost your Team
	* Things that correlate to Team Performance
		* IQ -> no
		* Satisfaction -> no
		* Cohesion -> no
		* Motivation -> no
		* More women -> yes 
			* Perhaps due to social sensitivity
	* Add creativity
		* Draw in circles
		* Finish my squggile
	* Process to add
		* Meditate
		* Talk to users
		* Prime creativity
		* Generate ideas independently
		* Reveal simultaneously
		* Remix
		* Analyze Critically


## ![Eva](https://i.imgur.com/8ncYSuHs.jpg) [Eva Kaniasty - To resist is human, to test divine! Overcoming objections to user research](http://uxburlington.com/speaker/eva-kaniasty.html)



* Research is great!
	* People don't always respond well to research
		* Underlying the resistance is fear (of failure)
		* Research brings more bad news (things that need change)
		* Fears
			* **Testing** (usability) - on trial
			* **Change** - process set in stone
			* **Wasting** time & money - pre-allocated to design and development
	* Design end product is fun
	* Design process is not easy
	* Research helps:
		* < Risk
		* < Uncertainty

* How do we break through?
	* Who's in charge:
		* Client vs. Design Agency
			* Client project worked much better because of buy-in
				* No Communication --> no influence

* Sectors
	* Startup, Government
* Who's in Charge
	* **Client**, Design Agency
* Research Type
	* Multiple Rounds, Single Round, Baseline
* Research timing
	* **Beginning**, Middle, End
* Testing format
	* Client location, remote, formal lab

* Timeline
	* Design -->  Dev  --> Testing ---> Live
	* Design ---> Dev ---> More Dev ---> OMG!

* Lessons
	* Connect
	* Collaborate
	* Iterate

### ![Katie](https://i.imgur.com/fjb5tAks.jpg) [Katie McCurdy - Designing with Empathy](http://uxburlington.com/speaker/katie-mccurdy.html)

* Works at [Open mHealth](http://www.openmhealth.org/) and [Notabli](https://www.notabli.com/)

* ~~Did was ask what our users want~~
	* People don't know what they want
		* "If I'd asked people what they wanted they would have said a faster horse" - falsely attributed to Henry Ford
* Do we understand the people we're designing for
	* What are their pain points and how an we solve that for them
	* Intuitive
		* Usable
		* Friendly
	* Complling
		* Pleasing
		* Fun
		* It understads me
		* I must have it

* Empathy helps optimize:
	* Form factor
	* Feature prioritization
	* Tone & Voice
	* Color palette & visual sytle
	* Marketing Messaging

* Research saves time and money
	* Upfront is cheaper than after the fact

* Interviews and Observations
	* **What** - set up time to talk to users
	* **Purpose** - Understand their context, problems, mental modals

* Listen to users - use feedback to create new taxonomy

* Participatory Design Session
* Synthesize findings
	* Can use analog pieces of paper
* Usability Testing
	* ex. People kept asking how much does this cost - added a little link blurb "Whoa, how is this free" to assuage fears

* Case Study - mHealth - LINQ
	* **Trust**!!
	* **Challenge**: "Prescribe" data tracking
	* **Research Activities**
		* Interviews w/ Doctors and Patients
		* Develop Peronas

* Design Principles:
	* Feels like magic, not work
	* At a glance understanding
	* Calm in the Storm
	* Guided, supported patient experience
	* Give the exact information and the exact time

* Insights
	* Doctor-patient relationship is hugely important
	* Asynchronous messaging is important
	* Patients put their meds out where they can see them
		* Prototyped tracking reminder cards

* Tools:
	* [UXPin](https://www.uxpin.com/)
	* [Flinto](https://www.flinto.com/)
	* [UserTesting.com](http://www.usertesting.com/)

[Unsuck the Enterprise](http://alistapart.com/column/unsuck-the-enterprise)

Works at [Jive Software](https://www.jivesoftware.com/about-jive/careers)

* Consumer vs Enterprise Software
* What's wrong with Enterprise Software?
	* Software used at work for work (ex. HR system)

Command Module Main Display Console

![Command Module Main Display Console](https://i.imgur.com/BGFaq9u.jpg)
- If astronauts can figure this out, it can't be that hard - but end users aren't astronauts

* Person Paying
	* Control
	* Configurability
	* Complaince
	* Number of Features
* End User Needs
	* Get stuff done

The death spiral - As fewer people are able to use the software, fewer people want to use it, until no one uses it anymore

* Too much Legacy
* Agile within waterfall
	* "Spirit of agile"
	* Doing sprints doesn't make you agile
	* Silos don't talk to each other
	* Bureaucracy

* Show the business the value of design
	* The Design Value Index (DVI)
	* From Software Engineering: A Practitioner's Approach
		* Design Change Costs:
			* 1X - During design
			* 6X - Before Launch
			* 100X - After launch
		* Bad Roles
			* Engineers - unwitting prototyperes
				* There are lighter weight alternatives
			* Users - unwitting testers
				* There are quicker feedback alternatives

* Fit research to budget
* Always have time to redo work 

* Explore
	* $$$ - Ethnographic Study
	* $$ - Phone Interviews
	* $ - Ask a freind
* Prototype
	* $$$ - HTML
	* $$ - Clickable Prototype
		* Proto.io
	* $ - Drawings
* Testing
	* $$ - Lab studies
	* $ - Starbucks


* Product Forces Framework
	* Progress *making* forces
		* **Push** of the situation
		* **Pull** of the new idea
	* Progress *hindering* forces
		* **Allegiance** to current behavior
		* **Anxiety** of the new solution

* Modern Collaboration Techniques
	* Product Discovery
	* Design Studio & Prototyping
		* Digital Whiteboard
	* User Research
		* Engineers will cry - and resiliently improve the product
		* Digital, recorded videos

* Overcoming resistance
	* Show them why it's important
	* Show them it's not going ot make their lives difficult
	* Give them a  framework that covers the whole product
	* Make them part of the process


### ![Maria](https://i.imgur.com/QSpaW0ns.jpg) [Maria Matveeva - Art history, culture, and color](http://uxburlington.com/speaker/maria-matveeva.html)

From [DockYard](https://dockyard.com/)

Lived all over the world - in addition to trying lots of food, helps understand different defaults for different people

* Too many choices
	* ex. Salad Dressing Isle
* Instead choose a system and create
	* ex. Creating a dressing oil and vinegar


* History
	* Old color system - distinct pigments - blue didn't exist along a spectrum
		* Cost of each pigment represented colors used
		* Colors
			* Blue -> Holy
			* Red -> Holy
			* Brown, Yellow -> 
	* The Milkmaid (Vermeer) (c. 1658) - Peasant portrayed in blue
	* Industrial Revolution - 1500s -manufactured lots of saturated colors
		*  New Pigment -> Overused -> Real artists use tasteful muted colors
		* Colors available in tubes
			* Don't have to stay in doors - outside has color again (ex. Claude Monet Haystacks 1880)
	* 1958 - Synthetically manufacturers Klein Blue
		* Trend List
			* IK BLue
	* Pop-art - color somewhat abitrary
		* Manufacturing process
			* Select Object
			* *Then* select color
				* Ex. Purses / Cars


* Culture & Context
	* Blue / Yellow Fence in Russia (looks like Ukranian Flag)
	* Homer's Wine colored sea
	* Different scales for colors
		* Light vs Dark
		* Shiny vs Flat Matt
		* Hue (red vs blue)
		* Japan - 12-layer cimono art
	* Red vs Blue
		* Republican vs Democrat
		* Boy (blue) vs Girl (pink)
		* Olden Tomes
	* Politics + Cultural Context + Language Differences + How Important is Color?
		* Check your assumptions
* Color Theory
	* Complementary
		* Opposite each other on color circle
	* Analogous
		* Close to each other on the wheel
	* Hue - Most commonly
	* Shade - How much black
	* Tinit - how much white
	* Chroma - Saturation
	* Gray Equivalent
		* How light or dark does the hue appear
			* Yellow appears lighter
		* Value Contrast --> Readability --> Accessibility
		* Hue Contrast --> Not readable
	* Color Sphere - Albert Munsell
		* Like Paint swatches
		* Determine contrast in grayscale
		* Make changing between colors easier

* Making color work for UX
	* If people care about how you've coded something, they'll definitely care about the color
	* Benefits of Color
		* Show related
		* Symbol
		* Psychology
		* Represent Data
		* Branding
		* Aesthetic
	* Google "UX design color guide"

* Three step system
	* **Resolve contrast** - in grayscale sketches
	* **Select the color** - 
		* know the users, use cases
	* **Refine Color** - make it awesome
		* Sketch in color - fail quickly - draw them next to each other
		* Don't forget proportion
			* How much of each color?
			* Color swatches -> Photo (pinterest)
		* Not black and not white
			* Warm shade of dark orange
		* Adjust one thing at a time
			* Contrast
			* Tint & Shade
			* Saturation
			* Hue
		* Remove color
			* Remove where you don't need it
				* Not entire project needs to use all colors
					* [Dribble](https://dribbble.com/)
		* Have a backup
			* Don't rely on just color alone
				* Yes - with Icon
				* No - with Icon
			* Labels with textures

* Fun facts
	* Facebook had to be blue
		* Mark Zuckerburg - color blind so only saw yellow and blue
			* Yellow - flower
			* Blue - Tech
	* Netflix - Red for movie theater seats
	* Spotify - Pick a light color and pick a black color from these pallets.  Logo changes a lot while staying on brand.


* Example
	* Pick your favorite color
		* Darken it by 10%
		* Make it half as saturated
	* You have a model of color that your mind can manipulate
	*

			* Pick a low-stress time for everyone
	* Conducting the ssion
		* Introduce
			* Prompt
			* No bad ideas - this isn't art
			* As many ideas as you can
		* Sketch
			* Turn it on their heads - draw upside down
		* Feedback
			* Introduce what they drew
			* Rose, bud, thorn
				* **Rose** - fully blossomed ideas to keep
				* **Buds** - ideas that need to be developed further
				* **Thorn** - avoided entirely
