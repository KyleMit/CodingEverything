# Patterns & Practices

## Releases - SemVer

* [semver/**semver.org**](https://github.com/semver/semver.org)
* [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/)

> Given a version number `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, increment the:
>
> * `MAJOR` version when you make incompatible API changes,
> * `MINOR` version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
> * `PATCH` version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

## Twelve Factor App

[The Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/)

1. **Codebase** - One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys
2. **Dependencies** - Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies
3. **Config** - Store config in the environment
4. **Backing services** - Treat backing services as attached resources
5. **Build, release, run** - Strictly separate build and run stages
6. **Processes** - Execute the app as one or more stateless processes
7. **Port binding** - Export services via port binding
8. **Concurrency** - Scale out via the process model
9. **Disposability** - Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown
10. **Dev/prod parity** - Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible
11. **Logs** - Treat logs as event streams
12. **Admin processes** - Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes

## Builder Pattern

* [Builder pattern - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern)

> The builder pattern is a design pattern designed to provide a flexible solution to various object creation problems in object-oriented programming. The intent of the Builder design pattern is to separate the construction of a complex object from its representation. It is one of the Gang of Four design patterns.
