[Apply instant loading with the PRPL pattern](https://web.dev/apply-instant-loading-with-prpl/)

* **PRPL** - Preload, Render, Pre-cache, Lazy Load
  * **Push** (or **preload**) the most important resources.
  * **Render** the initial route as soon as possible.
  * **Pre-cache** remaining assets.
  * **Lazy load** other routes and non-critical assets.
