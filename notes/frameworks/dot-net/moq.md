# MOQ

> Moq is intended to be simple to use, strongly typed (no magic strings!, and therefore full compiler-verified and refactoring-friendly) and minimalistic (while still fully functional!).

## Questions

* [Non-overridable members may not be used in setup / verification expressions](https://stackoverflow.com/q/56905578/1366033)

    > Moq creates an implementation of the mocked type. If the type is an interface, it creates a class that implements the interface. If the type is a class, it creates an inherited class, and the members of that inherited class call the base class. But in order to do that it has to override the members. If a class has members that can't be overridden (they aren't virtual, abstract) then Moq can't override them to add its own behaviors.

    Instead of this:

    ```cs
    var mockPagingOptions = new Mock<PagingOptions>();
    mockPagingOptions.Setup(po => po.Limit).Returns(25);
    mockPagingOptions.Setup(po => po.Offset).Returns(0);
    ```

    Do this:

    ```cs
    var pagingOptions = new PagingOptions { Limit = 25, Offset = 0 };
    ```
