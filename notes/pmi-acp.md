## Agile Manifesto

### [Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/)

* **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
* **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
* **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
* **Responding to change** over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.

### [Principles](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html)

1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.

3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.

8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

10. Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.

11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

### [Deming Cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA)

by Dr W. Edwards Deming

AKA Deming circle/cycle/wheel, Shewhart cycle, control circle/cycle, or plan–do–study–act (PDSA)
 
* Plan
* Do 
* Check
* Act

![PDCA](https://i.imgur.com/0VhyCOB.png)

**Waterfall** - 1 demming cycle
**Agile** - lots of iterations


### Agile Mindset

Role     | Traditional | Agile
---------|:------------|:------
PM       | command and control         | part of the team peer/couch
Customer | start & finish touch points | sits at the table (daily)
Work/Tasks | PM assigns | Team manages collectively
Communication | controlled; protocol [RACI Chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix) | out in open, radiators, team space
Decisions | chain of command/authority | team decides
Change | influence/avoid or make money from it | welcome & embrace for customer's advantage
Deliverables | Owner Transition at close | frequent, incremental, functional releases
Retrospectives  | end of project | end of iteration; daily
Favors | Anticipation | Adaption



**Delta** - hedge against implementation talk - focus on passing exam - learning by putting in context is still helpful. not here to sell people the merits of agile

## Agile Manifesto


[Manifesto for Agile Software Development](http://agilemanifesto.org/)

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:

* Individuals and interactions over <small>processes and tools </small>
* Working software over <small>comprehensive documentation </small>
* Customer collaboration over <small>contract negotiation </small>
* Responding to change over <small>following a plan</small>

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

[History](http://agilemanifesto.org/history.html)

On February 11-13, **2001**, at The Lodge at Snowbird ski resort in the Wasatch mountains of Utah, seventeen people met to talk, ski, relax, and try to find common ground—and of course, to eat.

### Mind Map (Mnemonic Device)

Values => Direction

![Compass](https://i.imgur.com/ikv0JA1m.jpg)

![Clock](https://i.imgur.com/o9c4pAn.png)

1. HP - Highest Priority
2. WΔ - Welcome Change
3. DF - Deliver Frequently
4. TD - Together Daily
5. MI - Motivated Individuals
6. F[ꟻ][F] - Face to Face
7. WS - Working Software
8. ∞ - SD - Sustainable Development
9. CA - Continuous Attention
10. S - Simplicity (work not done)
11. SO - Self Organizing
12. RI - Regular Intervals


[F]: http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/a7fb/index.htm

### Exam Tips

 * focus on empowering "**The Team**"
 * run away from waterfall / traditional approach
 * focus on theory, not practice (not how we do it at work)
	 * follow manifesto / scrum / xp / lean

Narrow choices by following value pairs (manifesto) & principles


### Manifesto vs. Methodology

* Threats / Opportunities
	* [SWOT Analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses Opportunities, Threats)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWOT_analysis)
		* Waterfall term
	* Risk analysis
		* probability
		* impact (+/-)

**Risk Adjusted Backlog**

* Normally prioritized by value
* **threats**/riskiness may be prioritized down ↡
* **opportunities** may be prioritized up ↑

Two Halfs

* First - work with PO to decide what's in sprint
* Second - just team - how are we going to get it done

**Sprint Team**

* **Scrum Master**
	* Servant Leadership
	* Not PM
* **Sprint Team**
	* Self-organizing, self managing
	* Cross-functional
	* No sub-teams, no titles, no titles
	* Accountable

**Team Size**

 * Minum 5
 * Maximum 9
 * Average 7 +/- 2

> Amazon's Jeff Bezos has a solution for this problem. He calls it the "two pizza rule": Never have a meeting where two pizzas couldn't feed the entire group.
> - [The 'Two Pizza Rule' Is Jeff Bezos' Secret To Productive Meetings](http://www.businessinsider.com/jeff-bezos-two-pizza-rule-for-productive-meetings-2013-10)

User Story always delivered within iteration

#### Daily Scrum

* Timeboxed (usually 15 minutes)
* Inspect & Adapt
* Everyone should answer three questions
	* What did you do yesterday
	* What are planning on doing today
	* What obstacles are you encountering
* Product owner not required

#### Sprint Review

* Half-day Meeting
* Showtime
* Key Stakeholders
	* Senior Mgmt
	* Product Owners
* Team
* User Sign off as part of Meeting (that's the clearance of UAT)
* Delivers a **Scrum Increment**
	* Potentially shippable product increment
	* the sum of all the work involved in the sprint

#### Sprint Retrospective

* 3 hour meeting
* does not include product owner
* "Inspect and Adapt"
* Answer 3 Questions:
	* How did it go? (people, relationships, process, tools)
	* What worked?
	* What needs improvement?
		* Create improvement plan



### SCRUM Roles

* Sponsor/Customer
* Stakeholder
* Project Manager
* Agile Coach
* Team Member
* Developer
* Team includes Scrum Master


### Scrum Artifacts

Extreme programming was created by Kent Beck

#### 12 Practices

1. `JAN` - Planning Game <small>(first)</small>
2. `FEB` - Small Releases <small>(shortest month of the year)</small>
3. `MAR` - System Metaphor <small>(march like a band)</small>
4. `APR` - <b>S</b>imple <b>D</b>esign (April <b>S</b>howers <b>D</b>aily bring May flowers)
5. `MAY` - Testing <small>(You "may" pass)</small>
6. `JUN` - Pair Programming <small>("June Wedding")</small>
7. `JUL` - Collective Code Ownership <small>(JULY -> Julius Caesar -> Ownership)</small>
8. `AUG` - Coding Standards <small>(August -> congress -> groups makes laws)</small>
9. `SEP` - <b>S</b>ustainable <b>P</b>ace <small>(<b>S</b>e<b>P</b>tember)</small>
10. `OCT` - <b>O</b>n-Site <b>C</b>ustomer <small>(<b>OC</b>tober)</small>
11. `NOV` - Continuous Integration <small>(November -> iNtegration)</small>
12. `DEC` - Refactoring <small>(December -> D_cembere_)</small>

### Lean

Started by Japanese Toyota car manufacturing

#### 7 Principles

1. `SUN` - **See the Whole** (Sunday -> see the whole day of the week)
2. `MON` - **Deliver as Fast as possible** (Deliver earliest day in the week)
3. `TUE` - **Empower the Team** (Tuesday -> Team)
4. `WED` - **Eliminate Waste** (Wednesday -> Waste)
5. `THU` - **Build Integrity In** (Thor's day -> Integrity)
6. `FRI` - **Ampli<u>fy</u> Learning** (Fri and Fy - Don't Fry the Amplifier)
7. `SAT` - **Decide as Late as Possible** (Sunday -> last day of the week)


Values -> Principles -> Methodologies (SCRUM, Lean, XP)

### Terms

* **Empiricism**
	* Transparency
	* Inspection
	* Adaptation
* **Lean**
* **DEEP**
	* Detailed
	* Estimable
	* Emergent
	* Prioritized

## Value Driven Delivery

**Project Selection / Chartering**

* Inputs
	* Business Priorities
	* Financial Measures
	* Compliance
* Outputs
	* Project Proposals
* 

**Value Based Prioritization**

*Bigger is better*

* **ROI** - Return on Investment
* **PV** - Present Value
* **NPV** - Net Present Value (in today's dollars)
* **IRR** - Internal Rate of Return

White Paper in Pages 81-87

#### Project Charter

* The charter is the authorization for the PM by name to perform the project
* Traditional and Agile Project!

**Charter Contents** <small>pg. 59</small>

* Charter should be written as part of **Iteration Zero** (if it does not always exist)
* It is created before significant actual project work commences
* Created based on some need AND should explain the need
* Signed by the performing org's senior mgmt
* Names the authority to apply resources
* Should include the high-level project requirements OR Critical success factors
* Should include a high level milestone view of the project schedule
* High level document that does not include project details
* Includes summary-level preliminary project budget


**Two Special Iterations**

* Iteration Zero - Planning
* Final Iteration - Hardening


#### Agile or Traditional?

* Agreement on Requirements / Scope
* Certainty of Technology


**Stacy Diagram**

![Stacy Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/zVfx0y9.png)

* **Chaos** - needs command and control
* **Simple** - Building a house a hundred times - waterfall is fine
* **Complex** - Agile Zone!

#### Brainstorming

* Gather ideas from a group
* Rapid-fire and inclusive
* non-judgmental flow

*evaluate, discuss, and group ideas afterward*

**Innovation games**

* **20/20 vision** - relative estimating of difficulty of features using cards
* **The apprentice** - observe other people doing process
* **Buy a feature** - given a fixed amount of money, buy features
* **Product Box** - physical representation of product - whatever you can put in the box
* **Prune the Product Tree** - Group users stories on wall

#### Ranking Priorities by Value

**MoSCoW Ranking Analysis**

* Must Have - Critical in this iteration
* Should Have - important mabe later
* Could Have - Desireable if time and money
* Would Like - Not Necessary

**Kano Analysis**

![Kano Analysis](https://i.imgur.com/vu1oUEu.png)


**Force Field Analysis**

* Ranked strength of forces, pro and con, related to a change
* Supports an objective decision whether or not to proceed

**Product Vision Statement**

*short, 30-second description* - elevator pitch

For *[who]* that need *[need]*, *[product-it]* provides *[end-state]*.
It provides *[valuable features]*.
It delivers *[expected benefits]*.

#### Minimally Marketable Features (MMF)

*the smallest set of functionality that adds customer or user value*

**Positive Value**

**Incremental Delivery**

* Deliver value more quickly
* Responsiveness to change
* Plan-Do-Check-Act
* Priority - highest value first

Users Stories

* often found on index card
* back of card has acceptance criteria

# "To me, this makes a lot of sense" *clicks next slide*

**Process Tailoring**

>Fail fast; fail cheap

**Non-functional requirements**

* Users Stories
* Part of Definition of Done


### SCRUM White Paper

http://scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v1/scrum-guide-us.pdf

**empiricism** - empirical process control theory

**Pillars**:

* transparency
* inspection
* adaptation

# Day 2

## Stakeholder Engagement

#### Stakeholder Analysis

* Chicken and the Pig - Ham and Eggs
	* Pig is committed, Chicken is merely involved

Stakeholders - anyone with an interest in the project


**Pillars**:

* transparency / visibility
* inspection
* adaptation

### User Stories

* Requirement (business function)
* Format
	* As A
	* I Want
	* So That
	* Acceptance Criteria
* Write on Notecards
	* Passed around
	* Ranked
	* Stuck on wall

### INVEST

[INVEST (mnemonic)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INVEST_(mnemonic))

* `I`ndependent
* `N`egotiable
* `V`aluable (verifiable)
* `E`stimable
* `S`mall (Sized Appropriately)
* `T`estable

### Epic

Large stories broken down and organized by functionality
Epic can plan multiple iterations

### Story Maps


Traditional          | Agile
---------------------|-----
WBS                  | Story Map
Hi-Level Deliverable | Epic
Work Packages        | Stories (INVEST)
100% Rule            | Not exact match
Decompose            | Disaggregation

![Breakdown](https://i.imgur.com/7cY1eJw.png)

## Product Planning

**Grooming** - A working meeting / agreement between stakeholders

### Product Planning - Persona

A fabricated, fictional user to bring a user story to life in a less general way (sometimes taken to the extreme)

* Format
	* Name
	* Description
	* Photo?

### Product Planning - Wireframes

* Replacing heavy documentation, a high-level way to convey concepts
* Non-working user interface design,
* Showing major functions
* No coding involved
* May be hand drawn

![Wireframe](https://i.imgur.com/0FMRkmZ.png)


### Definition of "Done"

*The team (include P.O.) must agree on exactly what done means*

* Passes acceptance
* Meets coding standards
* Signed off?
* No technical debt?
* No refactoring needed?

Kanban boards - limit **WIP** - Work in progress

### Scrum Board vs Kanban Board

**Scrum** - constrained to an iteration
**Kanban** - constraints work in progress (Japanese manufacturing term)

#### Terms

**Disaggregation** - break down an epic into smaller stories
**Grooming** - refinement of backlog - risk adjusted

## Team Performance

### Coach Role


* **Counselor**
* **Servant Leadership**
* **Adaptive Leadership**
	* Adapting to change! (often found in exam)
* **Build Team Unity**
	* What's going to motivate the team?

#### Ground Rules

* Expecations of team members
* Typically unwritten
* Clearly communicated
* Project-wide, team-wide


#### Interpersonal (Soft) Skills

* Emotional Intelligence (EQ)
* Collaboration
* Negotiation
* Active Listening

### Lea's Level of Conflict Model

1. A Problem to Solve
2. Disagreement (starts to become personal)
3. Contest (people want to win)
4. Fight/Flight (Crusade)
5. Intractable Situation (WW - damage control)

![Leas Model](https://i.imgur.com/ZiGPyVm.jpg)

##### Optimal Team Size

* Agile doesn't scale well
* Large projects/Teams -> divide up
* Scrum Team Size:  7 +/- 2

**Team Selection**:

* Willing to work as a team
* Agile experience preferred
* Skilled, self-directed, motivated
* Open, transparent

#### Coaching the SO Team

* Champion the process
* Promote interacton
* Get involved daily
* Counsel team, not lead team
* **Assign nothing** (*exam tip*)


#### Team Motivation

* Sustain, hi-performance team
* Support
* Participation
* Visibility

**Team Participation Motivates**

* Each member contributes
* Visible to team
* Individual Motivation -> Team motivation

#### Colocation

**Why?**
* Communication
* Collaboration
* Focus
* Minimize Distractions
	* **Heads Down Mode!**

**How?**

* One room, no barriers
* Facing each other, same table
* includes customer
* see, hear, interact
* No isolation, silos, or specialists
* Wall space, information radiators

**Protect the Team**

*Reduce distractions in order to establish a predictable outcome and optimize the value delivered*

Two Primary Vehicles:

* Scrum Master
* Information Radiation

**Osmotic Communication**

* Listening in
* No headphones (*Exam Tip*)
	* *Alternatively* - **Cone of Silence**
		* Scheduled Talking Hours
		* Headphones allowed
		* No interruptions

[Alistair Cockburn - Osmotic Communication](http://alistair.cockburn.us/Osmotic+communication)

![Communication Effectiveness](https://i.imgur.com/J7iYTEh.png)

![Communication Mediums](https://i.imgur.com/vGUFjOM.jpg)

#### Colocation when Remote

* Even more important
* Invest in technology for closeness
	* webcam links
	* instant messenger
	* skype
	* audio/video conferencing
	* face-to-face
	* Groupware (e.g. google sheets)

#### Pros and Cons Team Space

* Pros
	* Open
	* Small feedback loop
* Cons
	* Noisy

#### Earned Value Management
* Measure of how work and spending is progressing against the plan
* Mechanics of Agile not exam-relevant
* Based on Velocity (linear)
* Tracked at the iteration level
* Benefit? Organizational Compliance

#### Cross Functional: Teams vs. Individuals

**Ace the PMI-ACP® exam**

> In order to promote collective ownership and accountability Agile team members are expected to be cross-functional.  By cross-functional, we mean team members that are specialists in their areas, but still have adequate competencies at one or more other skills required for the project.  In other words, they could be comfortable wearing multiple hats as required during different times of the project. 
>  
> **For Example**:
> 
> * a developer, in addition to doing design, coding and integration, could write the scripts for an automated regression test suite that runs in an auto-pilot mode
> * a business analyst, apart from his core duties of doing in-depth functional analysis and helping to write user stories, could also lend a helping hand in doing some exploratory testing
> 
> Cross-functional skills are invaluable for Agile project teams, because of the following benefits:
> * With cross-functional teams, it is easier to take shared ownership and group accountability for results.

## Adaptive Planning

Discovery -> Product Backlog -> Delivery

#### Agile Discovery

* finding out what is wanted
* sometimes called the first step
* Value Driven tactics like:
	* product vision statement
	* user stories
	* product backlog
	* value based prioritiziong

**Dual Tracks Agile** (*on-going projects*)

Continue discovering and delivering throughout project duration

Plan Levels with Evolving Detail

#### Cone of Uncertainty

![Cone of Uncertainty](https://i.imgur.com/nDRwvYb.png)

#### Rolling Wave Planning

* Planning in stages, "waves"
* More details closer in time
* Natural Emergence of details


#### Progressive Elaboration

* Features, requirements, stories, tasks, details, characteristics...
* Not perfectly in focus in the beginning
* revisting and refining
* iterative and adaptive
* responding to change

**Waterfall AND Agile both Have**:

* Progressive Elaboration
* Rolling Wave Planning
* Project Charter

#### Product Roadmap

* Shows planned release and respective features
* It's what we intend, but it's not binding
* Allows you to see the forest before the trees
* 10,000 foot view

#### Release Planning

* Group iterations into a product release
* NOT a contract
* Two special sprints in every release
	* Iteration - 0 - intial sprint to outlay work
	* Iteration - 1 to N
	* Iteration - H - hardening sprint


#### Agile Theme

* Describes a high-level goal of an iteration
* Added funtionality that builds toward the release
* For example:
	* Reporting
	* Invoicing
	* Order Entry

#### Daily Stand ups

* Peer-toPeer
* Short, to the point
* Entire Team
* Same time, same place
* Max 15 minutes (team size 5-9)
* Not a status report
* Not a place to SOLVE issues (RAISE Issues)
* 3 questions:
	* What did you do yesterday?
	* What are you going to do today?
	* What are your obstacles?

#### Radiate Planning

* Make planning activities visible and transparent by encouraging participation


### Planning Levels

Plan      | Who  | What <small>(you plan)</small> | Why
----------|------|------------|----
Product   | P.O. | Value      | Need
Release   | P.O. | When       | Fast Value
Iteration | Team | Effort/how | Goal/Tasks


#### Spike

* **Decision time** - which direction?
* Small, quick, throw-away experiment to aid decision
* Helps determines next step
* Result of Spike (Deliverable) - Decision

#### Iteration Retrospectives

* Lessons learned
* immediate feedback; course corrections
* what worked / what didn't

**Adapt Estimates Iteratively**

* **Ideal Time** - if you could work, uninterrupted, with no breaks, what you would accomplish
	* Easier to estimate without uncertainty of overhead
	* reflects actual effor trather than duration
	* often used in agile estimating
* **Factor in Non-Ideal** - Adjust capacity by incorporating maintenance and operations demands and other factors in order to create or update the range estimate (SM / PO)

**Stories** - Estimate with Point
**Tasks** - Estimate points/hours + adjust for ideal time

### Burn Rate

* $$$ / time
* How much money you're BURNing through over a fixed amount of time

* Use to estimate costs
* Amount of cost estimated over a period of time
	* Cost per iteration
	* Cost per week
	* Cost per month
	* Usually cost of team

#### Sizing Techniques

* **Relative Sizing** - * Rank stories by relative effort
* **Affinity Estimating** - Decide on a grouping technique (i.e. T-Shirt Sizes)
* **Planning Poker** - Simultaneously reveal estimated points - explain high's and low's
* **Wideband Delphi** 
	* Buit ontop of Delphi Technique
		* "Blind"fold the judges to elimminate bias
		* All discuss together
		* estimatey separately
		* all plot range - discuss for consensus
		* repeat
		* individual estimates -> group wisdom

**Parkinson's Law** - Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion

#### Timeboxing

* Setting a fixed amount of time to work in a release
* Can only deliver the value that is "Done"
* Focus, urgency, and awareness

#### Kanban

#### Cumulative Flow Diagram

![Cumulative Flow Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/f0JGQyz.png)

Show WIP at any point in time - you'd like consistent heights for each section

**Cycle Time** - The amount of time to complete a feature or story

**Velocity** - The number of story points the team can deliver per iteration
 * Different for each team
 * Poitn are not equal across projects
 * XP - A pair cannto take more points thatn "done" in the previous iteration

**Burn-Up Chart** (shows done against the release plan)

* Generally against longer time frame
* Shows planned progress vs actual progress


## Problem Detection and Resolution

**Agile Smells**

**Escaped Defect** - Defect introduced that was not caught during sprint

**Root Cause Analysis**

**Ishikawa Fishbone diagram**

**Audit to minimize Cycle Time**

## Continuous Improvement (product, process, people)

#### Kaizen

> **Kaizen** - a Japanese business philosophy of continuous improvement of working practices, personal efficiency, etc.

* small changes
* Continuous improvement
* team focus amplifies effectiveness responsive to change


**Stop Waste** -> **Stream Value**

### Value Stream Mapping

* **Present State**
	* Value Stream
		* Process Stream
		* Process Stream
		* Process Stream
* **Gap Analysis** ↓
* **Future State** 
   * Value Stream
		* Process Stream
		* Process Stream
		* Process Stream

UML Diagrams (like Business Process Mapping)

Ex.

* Value Stream Mapping -> Buying Groceries
  * Process Stream -> Selecting a Cart
  * Process Stream -> Gathering Items
  * Process Stream -> Checking Out

## Course Summary & Final Exam

### Homework - After Course

* Complete PMI-ACP Application
* Memorize Brain Dump
* Perform Practice Test 2 (Textbook)
* Perform PMI-ACP Practice Test on [InSite](https://www.velociteach.com/)
	* Passing Grade ~70%






### Feedback

* Slides had way too much text
* Glossed over a lot of the terms at the end of the section
* Everyone wants to bikeshed - i.e. talk about what they already know because it's comfortable - not new material that we're actually here to learn because it's foreign
* Protect the Team - Slide 33 - thought the PO was supposed to protect the team (not scrum master)
* Spent time watching beer commercials, stand up routines, and juggling
* Would be helpful to differentiate Scrum, Lean, and XP
* Just read slides and tried to figure out what they meant live - would sometimes latch onto a word that had little do with current content
* Couldn't explain value of Continuous Integration (XP)
* "Do you want to fight about it" - I'm just trying to tell you what's on the test
* Rebuked Mnemonics - Could not do them himself, certainly couldn't help explain them
* Didn't know axis on Stacy Diagram
* Didn't know how to explain Chicken and the Pig
