## Agile Manifesto

[Manifesto for Agile Software Development](https://agilemanifesto.org/)

* **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
* **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
* **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
* **Responding to change** over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.
