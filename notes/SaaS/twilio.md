### Suppressions

* **Blocks** - The recipient's email server rejects the message for a reason related to the message, not the recipient address. This may be due to your Sending IP, or the message content. Since these are message-specific issues, future messages to these addresses are not suppressed.
* **Bounces** - The recipientâ€™s email server rejects the message, or sends the message back to SendGrid, due to an issue with the recipient address.
* **Invalid Emails** - The recipient address does not exist at the mail server you sent to.
* **Spam Reports** - The recipient marks your email as spam.
* **Global Unsubscribes** - When a user unsubscribes from everything you might email them.
* **Group Unsubscribes** - When a user unsubscribes from a specific group of your emails.
